"Patient care is very good, doctors and nurses are very helpful.",4
Predatory. I find out that this non profit hospital billed me 5k and set me up with an access one account instead of financial assistance AND I find out that they CHOSE to charge me interest for it. And they can't do anything about it now because it's LEGACY? They clearly saw we were young and didn't know what we were doing and preyed on us. Be careful and always ask for the financial assistance.,1
"Recently spent 5 days here with my mom after her surgery. I experienced firsthand the caring attitude of Nurses and CNAs - not one of them in the week I was there was anything less than professional and kind. I spent most nights there and they were quick to offer extra blankets and pillows to try to make me more comfortable. Nurses and CNAs also struck a nice balance in monitoring vitals during the night without needlessly waking up the sleeping patient.
 
 Our first two nights there, the patient on the other side of the curtain was absolutely terrible. Rude and disrespectful. Yet never once did I see one of the Nurses or CNAs lose their temper or respond in a biting or sarcastic manner (though I'm sure they wanted too!). After they left, we were impressed at the incredible thoroughness of the cleaning that hospital housekeeping did. Not only did they do the obvious cleaning, but also doors and the trash cans, bed frame and more. It made us confident in the cleanliness of the entire hospital.
 
 Cafeteria food is horrible. Truly. I tried a number of different choices from a cold wrap to a cheeseburger. It was all gross. I'm sorry to be so blunt, but I feel bad for the staff who must eat there. The staff in the cafeteria were also the only hospital employees that we encountered that were not friendly.
 
 The room itself was fairly spacious and had a window. There were chairs, but were only a step above a folding chair. Would be nice if there was at least one soft chair.
 
 All said and done, we were very happy with the experience here.",4
"Sad to say that not only from MY experience, but also taking my husband to the e.r., they get you in quick but treat their patients like garbage. One time i went in severe pain from an infection and they just sent me home.. my husband was just recently there for a severe medical reason and they sent him home in terrible pain with nothing to help him sleep, or control his issues till he could see a regular doctor, after he didnt get better, i took him to the albany hospital, they were very much more willing to listen and help, and treat him. If i choose, i definitely will be going to albany hospital over corvallis ANYTIME. Oh and one more thing.. YOU NORMALLY wont even see an actual Dr. Their e.r. usually doctors dont show their faces. It seems like it is ran like a circus.",1
Samaritan is a great choice if you need surgery. The nursing care is first rate and the doctors are totally professional and caring,4
"SamCare people efficient snd courteous HOWEVER no one mentioned bate and switch to out of network outsourced contracted Mary’s Peak ER physicians. After SamCare did all the work for my spouses foot fracture, out if network physician’s assistant came in for 5 minutes to tell her she has a fracture Daaahhh! No Dr Henderson as appeared on my separate OK. based $2,200 bill. Not the separate hospital bill of $325. Unethical, no transparency, buyer beware. Ought to be a class action lawsuit for such trickery.",2
"Skilled surgeon, kind and skilled CNA and RNs.",4
Some staff was amazing but the majority of my experience was traumatic. I don't know if I would ever go here again,2
Staff here are really disrespectful I had my daughter here and they messed up on everything from giving her a bath to early to not doing hearing testing or anything like that until we were bout to walk out this is not a place where u wanna have ur mod and on the other hand they lost out babys importan documents and are now calling us acting like we lost them when they have them NEVER HAVE YOUR KID HERE,0
Struggling to get through on the phone number listed. They cannot hear me. I have used 2 different cell with At&T and one with Verizon and neither one can hear me. I had no problems getting through on Tuesday and Wednesday.,3
Surgical team is top notch. They made me feel comfortable and relaxed. I needed to spend the night and there was not one bad Dr or nurse my entire stay. I'll even say when my blood had to be drawn the nurse was excellent. Didn't feel a thing. This has been the best hospital experience I've ever had.,5
"Terrible communication between staff and patients and patient families. Physicians do not read chart notes. Physician diagnostic errors. Physicians do not listen. Physicians more concerned about insurance rules than patient care.
 
 Also no communication between so-called hospitalist and primary care physician. A ""hospitalist"" is a physician on staff at the hospital only and treats patients in the hospital without consulting or informing the patient's primary care physician. Unless the patient's PCP is part of the Samaritan system, no medical history for a patient is available to the hospitalist.",1
Terrible service!!! They treat their patients like cattle. They are clueless!!,0
"Terrible service. Disrespectful, doctors, and nurses. Everyone in the building need at least 5 years of experience on top of what they supposed had.
 Was diagnosed with meningococcal, and they said they knew how to treat it. Yet, they still let infection go untreated. And somehow they forgot that meningococcal kill you in 24 hours and if you don't get treatment around the 16th hour, there is severe limb loss. I had been taken around the 10th hour. And didn't get treatment for several hours.
 In the end I lost both of my feet below the knees and 8 bits of my fingers that we're removed in the Portland at the burn center.
 To top it all. The doctors at good sam didn't want me to go to portland because they were ""just going to do the same thing"" they were going to do at good sam in corvallis.
 According to good sam (corvallis) the surgeries would have been amputation of my fingers to the knuckles and my legs to my hip bones. good thing i didn't stay.",0
Thank you to my nurses Megan and Jackie and for my CNA’s Chris and Josie for all taking such good care of me while I was stuck in the hospital all weekend. I appreciate you all!! Also thank you to the doctors for all the care as well. Everyone was amazing.,4
"The communication system is the worst I've ever encountered. It is impossible to reach your doctor directly by phone or email; every attempt to communicate goes through a central office that almost never answers, and is often staffed by temporary employees who are uninformed and unhelpful. Totally unsatisfactory -- even scary -- to be so helpless when in need of medical assistance!",1
The doctor and nurses I have dealt with are amazing and very compassionate.,4
"The emergency room of this hospital seems to be woefully understaffed or under supervised other than the reception staff and an x-ray technician. My visit included a quick reception, an initial nurse triage and vitals, and a not unexpected 2 hour wait for an x-ray. My not “unreasonable complaint” is regarding the additional 4 plus hours I calmly and quietly sat in the waiting room to hear the test results. In fact, while sitting in the waiting room, I could go on-line and read my test results of my X-ray hours before I was finally able to verbally receive them. After waiting an additional 4+ hours, (now over 6 hours total), I calmly inquired of the receptionist if she had any idea of how much longer my wait would be. At this time she immediately suggested I had another discussion with the admitting nurse. My response and the words I used were “that would be useless in my inquiry of how much longer the wait would be”. The nurse who originally did my triage screening happened to be nearby and heard me use the word “useless”. He aggressively confronted me and wanted to know if I had said “he was useless?”. I corrected him by telling him I had said another triage was going to be useless since it didn’t answer my inquiry. This nurse then proceeded to lecture me on the national average of hospital emergency wait times being 7.1 hours and how they triaged patients based on a patient's acuity, etc. After telling him I did not need his lecture, I then went and sat down again to wait. After this incident it wasn’t long and I was shown into a room, had a very kind nurse take my vitals again. A NP then showed up quickly with the attitude and empathy of a toad, probably because word had already gone around that I was a “problem patient”. The NP mentioned the x-ray showed no fracture, and pointedly insinuated I was drug seeking because I wanted something for pain. He did not talk to me at all about the diagnosed knee sprain or what to do about it. Only by reading my discharge paperwork after I got home, did I see the diagnosis and what I could do for at-home care.
 I am sure emergency room staff members suffer a lot from irate patients. I am sorry that they do. We all have to make our way through difficult days at work - but this was unbelievably unpleasant for all parties and totally unprofessional from this hospital's staff.",1
"The management of Corvallis Regional Medical center has TOTALLY mismanaged the beginning transition of food vendors. As a patient i am to dial room service and they will take my order. Sunday, June 4 a recording told me no orders will be taken but food will be delivered to your room from your physicians directive. No options or choices, breakfast was 2 hour late, lunch was 3 hours late, dinner was 1.5 hrs late. For me it was not very good in flavor or appealing to the palate. I wonder if the CEO was here would he impressed? If so there needs to be a change in leadership. The sad thing is, the hardest working best nurses and CNA’s were left with the upset captive audience.",1
The nurses and CNA's were so nice to me and they helped me get better in a couple of days and they would bring me my food when I ordered it and I also liked watching the T.V when I was there and the room that I was in was big and I didn't like it when I could only have one visitor in my room.,3
The nurses and doctors are somewhat friendly but my most recent visit to this place I was admitted through the ER and I needed help for problems with covid not be able to breath and the staff takes way too long to bring me back now readings show I'm ok but I couldn't talk felt like I was breathing fire and they could hear i was not okay and I was in bad shape now after dirty look after dirty look was just sent back to the room for an x-ray after about 2 hours was sent home. This is the worst hospital I've ever been too..,2
"The nurses in the ER are very unprofessional. The PA I saw was decent enough but the nurses gossiped the entire time I was there. When it came time to discharge me a nurse rushed me out and was cruel. The PA never even came into the room to tell me what was wrong. The nurse told me and she was very unprofessional about it. It was a very bad and degrading experience. It left me feeling humiliated. I will never go back to that place. The nurse who was cruel is heavyset, tall, blonde and has a nose ring.",0
"The nurses were very polite and very helpful. However the doctor didn’t seem to take my pain and symptoms very seriously and I came in with chest pain. An EKG showed my heart rate was abnormal but he didn’t take it seriously. The worst part was I had an IV in and when I was discharged they were doing shift changes but the nurse I got was very aggressive. As he was taking the IV out of my arm he actually bent the needle while taking it out. It was extremely painful and my arm bled for quite a while with lots of blood, more than I’ve ever experienced with an IV.",2
The people who work here are consistently the nicest. I've had to go to the ER a couple times and every time they're super helpful and reassuring.,4
These people treat you with kindness and respect. They are caring and helpful.,4
They take AGES! Ever get told you can leave but wait hours just for them to release you.,1
They took good care of me,4
They were so friendly and helpful. The beds that automatically adjust to each person are amazing!,4
They’ve been taking great care of my dad. Clean facilities. Friendly staff.,4
This hospital deserves ZERO stars. My dad has been a patient with them for 2 months and has had nothing but problems with his surgery. There isn't one Dr who will take responsibility and there is an extreme lack of care going on....with a Dr even admitting that the system is broken. Find another hospital immediately.,0
"This hospital has given terrible care to my wife’s grandfather who’s admitted in their ICU. If I could rate 0 stars, I would.",0
"This hospital has some of the rudest staff I have ever encountered. The receptionist by the name of Dominick has a terrible attitude and should not be in the position he is in, as he doesn’t care about the people coming in. There was also a vial of blood and a bloody gauze under the triage desk. Logan the RN was also very irritable and unprofessional. Not only does this hospital have horrible customer service, it is also very dirty and short staffed. I will never come back or refer this hospital again.",0
This hospital is a joke. My sister had her child and they would not let me see her. Saying flu restrictions. They won’t let me see my damn sister. They won’t even let me into the waiting area. I’ve had two back surgeries and have to wait on a bench as my parents get to see her. This hospital is a joke. They say it is to control the flu. No it’s to control people and prevent family from seeing their loved ones on one of the most joyous days of birth. They have a comment and feedback box with no cards to put in. So enjoy the trash I put in your suggestion box. Because that’s all your hospital is. Trash. I’ve now missed out on the birth of my niece. All because you will only allow 4 people back. If my sister New about that she would of had her kid at legacy. A REAL hospital.,0
This hospital sent me a $100 copay/deposit for my wife even though we did not receive Emergency Services as we had to let them know we had to get home after waiting in the Emergency Room lobby for hours.,2
This is my 17th year in Corvallis. My family was served by this hospital all these years. Two of my children were born there. I can say only good things about the doctors and nurses working in this hospital.,4
"This place gets the job done when you need them. It shouldn’t be reviewed like it’s a damn Starbucks in wonderland. I’ve been here for a broken toe, two kidney stones, a UTI, and a kid with an intestinal blockage. Each and every time they’ve gotten the job done. They bill like a hospital, so that takes away a star right off the bat. But I’m thankful as hell to have them in the community when they’re needed, and that gets them at least four stars.",4
This place has the honor of giving me the worst emergency department experience of my life.,1
This place is a joke!!!! I went in with severe flu symptoms and they brushed me off and sent me on my way with NO meds! I wasn't seeking dope! Prednisone and antibiotics would have been nice. I'll NEVER waste my gas driving from Lebanon to Corvallis ever again!!! Thanks for wasting my time and money!!! Oh and the fbomb was used A LOT!! VERY UNPROFESSIONAL!!!,0
This place is really great. The doctors and nurses are really attentive and have great bedside manners. Each of my parents have had extensive heart issues and we wouldn't trust any other hospital. They really do specialize in these sort of health issues.,4
This place was amazing for my father. Finally he got answers to a condition he's had for years. He was treated well and for a man who doesn't like hospitals he liked this place.,4
This was a very horrible experience. My daughter had to go in for a mental health hold. She was stripped to paper scrubs and had a few bracelets they made her remove but a few wouldn't come off so the doctor let her keep them. 3 days later a CNA named Skylie went and restrained my babygirl and cut her bracelets off and those bracelets were cut where they can't be fixed and they belonged to my daughter who had passed away 2 yrs ago. This CNA is very very rude she shoved my daughter down on the bed by her face. There is no need to do that to a 80lb girl. Of course she's going to fight it because those bracelets were mentally attached to her they belong to her sister who is no longer here and she had him on for 3 days with no problem until this person came in and thought that they needed to cut them off so thanks Skylie for making my daughter even have a bigger mental breakdown. I am having other people get involved with this because people like Skylie shouldn't be working in a place like this.,0
Took our daughter in for ankle Xrays and the staff were wonderful! Very friendly and accommodating!,4
"Uncaring and cruel. Released me in the middle of the night with nowhere to go, my family was asleep and my phone died. A small man from the police department forced me off the property and I almost froze to death.
 
 I have no idea how this place is still functional. Whatever.",0
"Very clean, easy to find with helpful staff",4
Very frustrating having the rules change with every different nurse/CNA that is taking care of my wife. Some of these people really are just here for the job and not for the patient care,2
Very poor service. It’s a shame that this place is open . Staff is rude and treat you very poorly.,1
Very rude front staff. Shows no concern and care towards anyone. Was extremely rude and showed no kind of urgency at all.,0
Waited hours in pain in the waiting room. The woman at the front desk should have chosen a different career she was rude and impatient and so insultingly fake. She honestly has no business being in a hospital. Can't comment on care as more than two hours later I am still waiting.,1
Waited nearly 7 hours at the ER. Absolutely insane.,1
"Was told by the doctor I could wait on my uncles room, nurse wouldn't let me, she suggested I go to the cafe and have some lunch while I wait, cafe waited until I payed to tell me I would have to eat in my car. I have cancer in my back and long walks become very painful,,, no one in the terrible hospital cares. I suggest the employees go to their cars to eat because their was plenty of them eating in the cafe, without mask and several tables with multiple diners.. If I wanted to walk out to my car I would left and had a good lunch.",0
"Wasting 3 and a half hours in the ER with a severe back injury only to be told they only use their MRI machine if you've lost control of your bowels or you've lost feeling in your limbs is one of the dumbest things I've ever been through, why have that ridiculously expensive piece of equipment if your not going to use it. You have the patient in the room, you've said they need to have a MRI yet you tell them they will need to find a different DR. and schedule one that's possibly 2 to 3 weeks out.....doesn't make any sense at all to me, went hone in just as much pain as I arrived with and didn't get the much needed MRI.",1
We waited in the EMERGENCY ROOM for 5 and a half hrs and the people were downright rood and my girlfriend was balling in pain never offered a blanket or anything will not be going to this hospital again will make the stretch and go to salem or Eugene,1
Went to Samaritan in Corvallis to have varicose vein taken care of. After the procedure I would phone with questions because my leg was sore. Last call I was told could take 6 months to heal and continue to wear sock. 6 months later leg hurts more and looks worse than before procedure,1
"What a joke! If you need mental health help run away from this place! All they do is lock you in a room for days, weeks, or months to stare at a wall. Benton country health Dept is the same way. A big joke. All I wanted was help.",0
"Wonderful regional hospital. Not perfect, of course. That's universal in health care. But still a great place to receive care. I've always had good experiences there.",3
Wonderfully caring staff and fast service,4
wordless service,2
Worst emergency room care!,1
"Worst experience I've ever had with the admittance staff on the morning I brought my daughter in. The particular young man and triage nurse could not have come across more uncaring and sarcastically snippy. It was really strange. Horrible experience with them. The emergency room staff was great though, that's why I gave them a 2 and not a 1.",3
Worst medical experience I've ever had. David is a garbage nurse and has no business dealing with patients. He assaulted and berated me for wanting answers about tests that had been performed hours earlier.,0
"You have to go out of your way to seek financial transparency, billing statements will not be clear. You'll be charged for services tacked onto your appintment without discussing financial implications. Inequitible financial literacy practices, make sure you know the right questions to ask AHEAD OF TIME or else you'll be paying way too much.",1
