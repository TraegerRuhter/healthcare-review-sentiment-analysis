". I would formally like to make a complaint about the lack of sensitivity we have experienced. As well as an inability to pick up on signs of agitation from a patient by the night shift nurse. Not only has he repeatedly spoken to my grandma like she if an incoherent 5 year old but his meditative practice way of speaking comes across as demeaning and has according to my grandmother made her angry and uncomfortable. I'm also concerned about her Catheter bag full of urine that's been full for going on three hours now and no one has even came in to check it. There is an overall air of pompousness in this hospital, for example a respiratory therapist making a remark that anything to do with the nurses is beneath her and her pay grade. That is highly unprofessional, this isn't a fast food joint this is a prominent health establishment and should be handled as such. Similar behavior was exhibited by doctors here today to other members of the family towards the doctor that sent us here from another hospital this morning. Those comments should never be in front of a patient or patients family and they all were. The day time nurses for the most part were fairly decent though several showed examples of this same ideology and behaviors that we all overheard In the waiting room next to my grandma's room. it would be beneficial for future patients if the staff here were educated on proper communication styles to better connect with their patients. This night shift nurse Matt is not answering all the questions I am asking on my grandmothers behalf and that's a problem as I've expressed my concern about her recieving meds that she isn't supposed to have anymore and he utterly just brushed me off. I will be requesting with the lead nurse in the morning for him to no longer be allowed to take care of my grandma. It's also been all day long and we still have yet to see her physician or hear from him face to face which should be standard procedure, especially considering she was brought in due to having had a heart attack earlier in the day. The overall feeling was that of dismissal and a lack of caring. I imagine we aren't the only ones who've suffered this treatment, which is now the second time we've been here and dealt with this, since It happened last time we were here also. You're CNA staff is wonderful I hope they are on their way to becoming nurses themselves to replace the arrogant ones currently working here. They've shown more compassion than any other 'class' of workers you have on your payroll thus far. This is a huge disappointment and it's scary for a worried family member to feel comfortable leaving a loved one in the care of people that act like this. I will be advocating very strongly against anyone coming to your facility, as I'm sure you can see on your reviews the majority is one star and I'm sure the only reason you even got one from others as with myself is because there were no negative stars to give.",0
"A lot of people complained about stupid stuff, these people saved my life, and when I was recovering they were incredibly patient and persistent in making sure I was comfortable. I owe them so much",4
"A month before the pandemic hit, I took my partner to this hospital to seek treatment for a respiratory infection (a cold, not Covid-19). My partner had a longstanding spinal cord injury and needed to be in a hospital whenever she got a cold or flu so that she could receive respiratory therapy treatments. She was in good health except for the respiratory infection. But she was experiencing a surging wave of clinical depression and anxiety brought about by her having been fired by her pulmonology doctors in Eugene. Depression had plagued my partner since childhood - since before the spinal cord injury. She was considered by her pulmonologists to be a ""non-compliant patient"" and they refused to treat her anymore if she came to one of the hospitals in Eugene. As a result, she was in the process of suing them. So we came to Good Samaritan, thinking we could escape from the horrors of her situation in Eugene. Shockingly, this hospital has a ""Patient Care Services"" team that roams the hospital in search of depressed, vulnerable patients and repeatedly tries to sell them a peaceful, comfortable transition to the hereafter. They are the closest thing to pure evil I have ever encountered. Offering euthanasia to people who are not gravely or terminally ill but who are clinically depressed is an unspeakable act. If you have a loved one who suffers from a brain disease with suicidal ideation as a known symptom, such as clinical depression, bipolar disorder, an anxiety disorder, a delusion disorder, a psychotic disorder or a personality disorder, do not take them to this hospital! Your loved one may be repeatedly approached by the ""Patient Care Services"" team and take them up on their sales pitch for peace and comfort, at which point the doctors and nurses will go on a death care plan in which family members who do not go along with the death program are harassed and threatened. They do not want their patient to be talked out of death, as that would disrupt the death program. My partner was euthanized by the ghouls in this hospital. I was unable to stop it. Medical professionals should strive to cure disease processes such as brain disorders and treat the symptoms of these disorders. They should not collude with symptoms such as suicidal ideation and end up taking innocent lives in the process. I suggest going to a hospital that is affiliated with the Catholic Health Association of the United States. In theory at least, these hospitals should have less of an inclination to push death on their patients. The Providence hospitals in Portland are examples of this sort of institution. PeaceHealth Riverbend hospital in Springfield is also Catholic affiliated, but I strongly don't recommend going there. They have a MAJOR problem with their charge nurses, critical care doctors and ethics board.",0
"A real and definite lack of professionalism surrounds the staff. Granted, hospitals aren’t known for being places of enjoyment, the team should consider ways to improve their general attitude towards their guests. The nurses showed little enthusiasm and offered less than sufficient care.",1
Absolutely terrible. In obvious unbearable pain and absolutely wasted my time going here. The hospital staff must of thought I was lying or there for pain killers. ( Doesn't help having long hair and tats) (&) ( Two College Degrees) and stuck me in a room that looked like a delivery room. The room smelt like truck tire and didn't have any medical equipment. Staff wasn't friendly or helpful in any way. They probably put a dishwasher in uniform to come talk to me.,0
"after coming here more than 20 times for needing to be stitched up for self harm related issues, they stitched me up but kept mumbling things under their breath like ""why do they keep bring her in?? telling me that i ""was mad at myself so that's the reason i did this to myself,"" ""you never learn new strategies."" being rude in stressful situations is one thing they are very good at. DO NOT GO HERE!",1
"After comming home from an ER visit in corvallis, and then spending all night in pain, I had to go down to the Universities urgent care to get a proper diagnosis and the oposite perscription from the samaratin ER",1
Always have a horrible experience with nurses and other staff members. They don't like that i add input into my medical treatment and they like to communicate loudly and passively for the clients to here. Horrible hospital horrible staff,0
Apparently the woman with burns on her legs so bad they are blistering and she is bawling in pain is not a freaking emergency to this er,1
At first it was a great experience then towards the end they just left me to the side and they were incredibly slow and uncaring towards my ailments. next time ill drive to albany.,3
Awesome doctors & nurses on labor&delivery!,5
"AWFUL !!! They, and institutions like them, are the reason Health Care is so expensive. Not only do they find the most ""Willfully Ignorant"" people to employ, They have ""Self Absorbed"" doctors that don't care one way or the other if you're well or not. It saddens me that I even have to give them a star.",0
Beautiful and kind nurses...,4
Beautiful place to work in every way.,4
Best hospital I think the Albany one sucks cause they don't care about anyone but there pay check. But the Corvallis one they know how to take care of their pateints and make u feel very welcome and at home,4
Best Samaritan Hospital I've been to...,5
"Best. Hospital. Ever. Seriously, every experience here has been unreal. Broken arm, prenatal appointments, baby prep classes, birth of my son, everything. Love them.",5
"Beware of Mary's Peak Emergency Physicians who work there. They bill separately and always claim they never received your insurance #. Even after my insurance paid them and told us not to pay them anything more, they continued to bill and took us to small claims! After my husband went last month, I had their billing tell me his insurance # was smudged! It's in the computer! I'm hunkered down for 8 months of hell.
 
 Update: 2 months later. Insurance paid Mary's Peak Emergency Physicians, but their collection agency sent us a bill for the remainder - despite our insurance saying to ignore them.",1
Booo,2
Chest pain patient. Terrible ER. Hope I’ll never have to go here again.,0
"Denied urgent care while having insurance from a major health care provider. Was not even given the option to pay out of pocket at the front desk. Complete disaster, would rate 0 stars if I could.",0
"Deplorable treatment of patients and their families. I had visited my fiancé for 2 days in a row and they would not let me today because I've been ""exposed"" to COVID. I have no symptoms whatsoever and neither does he. They gave him two COVID tests- one was positive one was negative. To any logical person, it would seem he had a false positive. I am also fully vaccinated and was wearing a mask. They let me wander throughout the hospital while they made me wait yet would not let me see my fiancé.
 
 They kept me waiting for about an hour and kept making up excuses as to why I could not see him. I have a panic disorder and started to experience a panic attack and was crying. Thats it. I wasn't yelling, cursing, threatening, etc.
 
 Before I knew it, I was surrounded by 4 staff members and a security guard. I just wanted to know what was going on with my loved one. They treated me like I was a criminal even though I told them I have a panic disorder and was obviously experiencing a mental health crisis. They were not empathetic at all they were callous, rude, and hostile. They kept escalating the situation and even told me I should drop out of school.
 
 I really hope these people are ashamed of themselves. They treated me like a threat when I am really just a young, petite woman with an anxiety disorder. I was just upset and confused because they were verbally attacking me and felt like they were being biased for no reason and changing the rules.
 
 I know the staff here is probably used to dealing with people who are anti vax and ridiculous and threatening, but I was not one of them. Train your staff to be better in general but especially in de-escalation techniques and being kind to patient's families, especially those with mental illness.
 
 For anyone thinking about coming here or taking a loved one here, DO NOT DO IT. Go absolutely anywhere else. Go to Portland its worth the drive because if your loved one ends up passing away, I doubt they'd even let you say goodbye here if you're ""exposed"" or show any kind of emotion.",0
Don't expect helpful people if you have to call them. They won't give guidance for your sick kids over the phone. Instead they want you to bring them into the ER to give you advice about a fever.,1
"Dr. Weisensee is the most educated, kind and he's a good listener. Great personality and just a great person.",4
"Everyone I spoke with recommended this place over Salem hospital for cardiac care. Dallas hospital in Polk county cannot do anything for cardiac patients and wasn't recommended for care in general. I had a great experience here. It was almost like a dream how respectful and kind, and timely everyone was. I would come back in the future to this place when needed. Thank you good Samaritan hospital! One star off because an elderly person down the hall was repeatedly yelling "" help"" and nobody heard her for 30 minutes except me because my room was by hers. They had gotten a little busy. If you are elderly and frail or soft spoken make sure to bring an advocate to help you. They only allow one person to go back with patients. Not two. This elderly lady was too soft spoken to be heard down the hall but I pressed my call button and someone finally heard and helped her. My favorite part about this hospital was the phone charging station and comfortable waiting area seats and the neat little aquarium which is also in the waiting area. I also thought the check in ladies were very quick and respectful. I like that they have an electronic signature tool and do not give you a ton of paperwork to fill out like other hospitals which makes check in a breeze. I would recommend bringing headphones if you are an anxious person because I did see security removing some loud and unruly people but they are quick and don't mess around lol. Prepare to be here several hours once you get into a room. I was here from 9:30 pm to 1am but I was there for cardiac care and I did see some others get in and out quickly so it might depend on what you are there for. Overall I definitely recommend this hospital 🏥 bring your own food and drinks especially with the long wait times in the actual patient room because they won't give you food or drinks while you are waiting for your test results. It can be a little rough to be hungry or thirsty that long. They do have a snack machine in the waiting area but there's also a sign that asks patients not to eat or drink until seen by a physician. I'm small so I have to eat or drink or I'll get dizzy. I snuck some sips of water and had a few crackers and it was fine lol. Do not worry. Rooms have wall plugs so bring your phone charger because the charging station is only in the waiting area not the actual patient rooms. I didn't ask for an ice pack but I'm sure they probably would have given me one if I did. I usually get anxious and having an ice pack from my freezer at home helps keep me calmer while waiting or even getting blood work. You're in charge of yourself so make sure you are prepared before coming to any hospital because they can't always give people what they need/want right away or at all. It's nice to have what you need the exact moment you need it. You can help yourself by being prepared before leaving home.",4
"Everything was great except, no body returned my wallet from a emergency room, still can’t believe it.",3
"Excellent hospital, so many helpful folks to help you find your way around. The emergency room experience was positive.",5
First time I’ve ever been to the Corvallis hospital. My mom and I took my very sick daughter in last night. The nurses were very helpful as was reception. When we got to see the dr. He was very thorough. The whole team was very friendly. Everyone involved went above and beyond to help my daughter. I am so very grateful for everyone and their hard work and compassion.,5
for blood kits go on Mon-thurs between 7-12,2
"Got blamed for going to the emergency because I had a chest pain and the nurse was like ""Emergency is only for life threatening situations."" She made me feel guilty about going there.",1
Got hung up on multiple times while trying to get a hold of a love one and was refused to be allowed to talk to them. THIS IS THE WORST HOSPITAL AND THEY HAVE THE MOST DISRESPECTFUL STAFF I'VE EVER MET.,0
Great care given when I was recently admitted at the Short Stay Center for an ear surgery. Very professional and friendly nursing and care staff.,4
great doctors excellent care,4
Great place to work!,4
"Had an emergency room visit with good health coverage. My deductible was due at the end. I don’t make nearly as much money as before (started a new venture). I was in the loop with the main billing department for MONTHS trying to get my financial assistance underway. They still sent my radiology bill to collections. I mind you, I never had full instructions on how to submit said paperwork in the first place. Got sent to drop off paperwork to the wrong location and the lady at the counter was rude. I was missing a PIECE of my tax return and it wasn’t the full thing, so radiology sent me to collections. Like, how do you people not communicate to other departments? The financial directiors decided my tax return was insufficient, but never thought to mention it to Radiology? The clerk at radiology didn’t even know I moved, even though I updated my address on my portal months ago. Get it together. It’s very rude and unprofessional to send someone’s bill to collections and deem them ‘unworthy’ of applying for financial assistance when you don’t even communicate how to do so in the first place? My account did open back up, but I was super disappointed that they tried to serve me paperwork AT MY PLACE OF WORK. Even if I was barely clinging to life I would request a different hospital. One and only visit.",1
"Had the worst medical experience ever. Went to the ER, and it was a total waste of time. Had to go to urgent care in Albany the next day to have the problem fixed. The ER physicians assistant has zero business treating patients. My wife and I were shocked by the blatant incompetence.",0
Helpful friendly staff,4
"Horrible hospital. I went to the ER, saw a nurse practitioner, and almost got killed by either a nurse who didn’t know which end of an IV was up and with horrible medication that made me sick. The ER nurse told me I was being a baby and made nasty jokes about my illness. I told the nurse that I was allergic to a medication and she replied to take it or I will make your life miserable. I would tell anyone who ends up in this hospital to make sure you’re being taken care of by a doctor, not some nurse who wants to play doctor for a day. Save a life, seek a REAL doctor.",0
Horrible labor experience.,1
"HORRIBLE! We waited 9 hours in the ER, multiple people got pushed ahead of us who seemed fine.",0
"Horrible. I was taken here by ambulance after a car accident, I was headed to a job interview (11am) when I crashed off 34. I was diagnosed with a severe concussion and given a few stitches. Very lucky. But the “team” treated me like trash, if you can even call them that. The doctor was excessively rough with handling open wounds on my hands, way too rough. They left me alone in a room with a Police Officer who yelled in my face interrogating why I had crashed. I was concussed and this terrified me and hurt my head. Do not go here. Do not take your loved ones here, go to Salem or Portland, PLEASE.",0
Horrid would get better care from Dr. Kevorkian,0
Husband and I have always been treated great there.,4
"I can't say enough positives about the care i received in the corvallis er. Great staff, and I was taken care of in the most thorough and compassionate way. I only wish I lived locally so this could be my home hospital. Kudos to an excellent staff, from techs to Dr's.",5
I cant say enough great things about my care especially the icu nurses.....they were amazing I felt like I was their only patient and im sure the rest of the patients felt rhe same way. Their care was top notch,5
"I didn’t even know there was a hospital in Corvallis. Best care! Awesome nurses, great doctors. Would recommend.",5
I don't working there was horrible the last six years. They need to get out there and work with us in housekeeping. Management stresses you out and makes you sick. They suck,1
"I found the staff to be compassionate, caring and competent. Thank you for taking good care of my mom",4
I had a traumatic and horrible birthing experience here. I also went here for an emergency appendectomy where they almost diagnosed me with the wrong thing at first. Avoid all hospitals in linn and Benton county!,0
"I had come in by ambulance because I was non responsive, I have done this before and the docs have said that I had strokes. Once I came to this last visit the doc came in and I felt like he was short with me and treated me like I was faking.and had no answers. I asked if I could go home and he said yes. Then the nurse came in took my IV out and said I could get dressed. I then said I had no clothes since they cut them off of me. She sent someone to get me paper clothes and asked if I needed a wheelchair.( First of all she should have helped me get dressed since my legs were week but whatever I just held on to the bed and did it myslem and why would she even ask if I needed a wheelchair, I guess she thought I should just walk out after being basically I was paralyzed). The CNA that wheeled me out where front desksiad was stopped us aayins I had to pay my co pay...(with what I had no purse), I guess the perimedics were supposed to find it so I had my purse to pay that. Over all I felt so disrespected and told my husband if I have another one just leave me be and wait until I come to and can move, Just hope it wont be a bad one and can't come to or move my body.",1
"I had my first ER experience ever last Sunday. I was bucked off a horse and in a lot of pain. Everyone at the ER was amazing, with great attitudes and good sense of humor. I truly appreciate you all, from intake to nursing and imaging staff. You all did your best to make me comfortable. Many thanks!",5
"I had my first two cranial skull surgeries at Good Samaritan Hospital. When I was a baby. Because of the syndrome I was born with. Had caused deformities in the skull.
 
 I had a seizure in the 8th grade, and was taken by ambulance to Good Sam. In which they sent me down to Sacred Heart Medical Center in Eugene. As they didn’t have a pediatric neurosurgeon at the hospital. At the time.
 
 But, I want to talk about my two recent hospital stays. One was from September 30th-October 8th. Which was the scariest moment of my life. I had sepsis among other issues.
 
 I had the best care from the nurses, and doctors during both stays. The first hospital stay. I was in the oncology unit, and have never forgotten the great nurses who took care of me. Even though my case was never related to cancer. I still had good care at the unit.
 
 The second time I was admitted. I was in the medical-surgery unit. The best part of that stay. Was that my room overlooked the LifeFlight helicopter pad. I was in the new wing of the hospital. Right above the newly remodeled emergency room.
 
 It was fun watching the LifeFlight helicopter come in, and take off. Even at night. From my window. Even though being in the hospital is never fun. That was the best part of my hospital stay the second time.",4
"I had the best experience here with my appendectomy. I got surgery the morning of January 29th. The nurses, surgeons, physicians and staff were all amazing. A special shout-out to nurse Autumn I freaking loved that lady! Overall experience was a 10/10.",5
"i hate this place lowkey gives me ptsd. i was in the safety room while i was very manic, in a very bad state of mind and they wouldn’t let me call or see my mom after promising she would come back. also lied about not having food and drinks past 5pm, they always have food. that’s illegal for them to keep my mom away especially if a patient is in a manic/psychotic depressive state because seeing family and having them by my side to remind me how i was before would help my mental state. some of the doctors were cool but a old lady doctor gave me 10x higher amount of Benadryl then i was supposed to have and she basically stabbed me with the shot. pretty sure she used the amount of a full grown man. used all of her force and was very harsh with it. my leg hurt for two weeks after and i had a huge bruise. it wasn’t a normal shot. i woke up
 talking to people who were not there after she gave me the Benadryl, i could not stay awake because at the amount was so high. this was a horrible experience and i wish i could do something to prevent other patients from getting this doctor, but there’s only so much i can do. if you find yourself ended up in here do everything you can to get out, because they won’t let you go. 0/10",0
"I have been visiting my fiancee at Good Samaritan Hospital in Corvallis since December 15, 2012. I have never been in a hospital that has been as caring, efficient, and professional as the good people here. They have taken amazing care of my fiancee, and will continue to do so until he is healed. His room is always clean, the nurses are quick to respond to his needs. The surgeon has been there for him in all ways.
 The Hill Top Cafe has a great variety of meals to choose from you would be hard pressed to find a better tasting, reasonably priced meal anywhere else. The Healing Garden is a beautiful area to walk around or just sit on one of the many benches scattered throughout. My fiancee loves to walk down there, with his IV pole, and just unwind. It is very peaceful.",5
I have had several surgery and I will say the staff has been great and actually care about patients.the staff on the 3rd floor that has cared for me are exceptional. Thank you all so much.,4
"I have never experienced such a rude group of employees as I encountered at Corvallis Clinic and Sam Internal Medicine and Calapooya Family Medic. The provider at Calapooya couldn’t speak English well enough to explain anything. The staff in the Referal Dept took more than three weeks to make one call and then couldn’t figure out where any Neurologist were. The NP I saw in Corvallis was more concerned about the time than actually listening to me as a patient. The political arrangement between Corvallis Clinic is choking the access to care all over the Linn County area. This is what Obama allowed to happen and now the corporates are managing Health Care, no compassion, no common sense, and be watchful of how they handle your private information, not exactly within HIPPA guidelines.",1
"I have spent 2 extended stays here during May 2022. Each time I was treated with compassion, respect & the care that I recieved was top quality. If I needed emergency heath care in the future I would definitely retutn to this facility.",5
I love this place due to the people who work here. Nurses are the best. Compassion is the order of the day. Even the food is good. Great fish & chips.,5
"I used to be someone who went to the doctor when something was clearly wrong, even despite expense, but my experiences here turned me into someone who avoids them at all cost. With the exception of one phlebotomist who no longer works there, my experiences with Samaritan has ranged from invalidating to borderline traumatic.
 
 I have a terrible phobia of needles - really, really terrible - but I have to get regular blood draws. I warn every phlebotomist beforehand and inform them of what they can do to make it easier for the both of us, but here, I had one hold me down to the chair, ignoring my panic attack and the fact that I was moving too much to be safe. When I screamed for him to stop, he threw his hands up in the air, said ""I can't deal with this"" and walked out, leaving me alone in the room. He never came back so I let myself out. Since this, my phobia has compounded and I've missed many required blood draws.
 
 I went in about dizziness - bad enough that it forced me to pull over while driving. I was squeezed in early because of the severity of that symptom, but upon meeting with the doctor (resident doctor actually), my experiences were immediately brushed off as a result of my anxiety or cannabis use, despite my observing no correlation. I had to ask to be checked for an ear infection, and even then, she only checked visually, not with an ear culture. I told her that keeping a journal had historically not worked for me as it skewed my experiences to focus so much on the episodes, but she simply told me that she couldn't help me without that information (because she didn't trust my observation) and sent me on my way without discussing any alternative plans. This issue has since worsened and I continue to notice no interaction between them.
 
 I went to see a gynecologist about severe abdominal pain, and they immediately identified a different issue - one I had been told by several doctors was nothing to be concerned about - and refused to address the issue I came in for until they'd addressed this one. Without discussion, I was prescribed an off-label drug which, when I later brought it up to a different medical professional, I learned would have been a terrible choice for my system. I was sent away with no further assistance or discussion. In a single visit to Corvallis Clinic, I've since identified the cause and started towards treatment.
 
 I was ambulated to the ER due to severe vertigo and vomiting (remember how I said the dizziness had worsened?) . I don't remember much because I was so out of it, so I can't speak for that. However, when I later went in for my follow-up appointment, my experiences were again brushed off as nothing, and I had to ask to discuss the (very expensive) test results. Gained nothing.
 
 In every one of these experiences, I was made to wait an hour past my scheduled appointment time, only brought into the room after I asked 20 minutes past my time what was going on, and not seen until 40 minutes later. No nurses ever came to check in on me and ask how I was doing or explain what was taking so long. I actually took a nap once while waiting.
 
 I've visited Samaritan numerous times and have never received any helpful diagnosis or any competent treatment, though they are happy to charge me as if I had. Save yourself the headache and the money and go anywhere else instead.",0
"I want to sincerely appreciate some staff here. After leaving the hospital with our newborn baby, we have to deal with corrections of paperwork from different authorities. These processes can possibly delay us for more than 3 months.
 I thought our names were pretty short and easy to handle. I was wrong. They not only misspelled my first name aka the father's name and kept it on the baby's birth record; they also mistakenly left my wife's last name for my baby on the insurance.
 This is so ridiculous that I feel a little confused. Are these usual typos you expect to create every day here? Are these secret presents for us after leaving the hospital?",2
I want to thank all the nursing staff on the second floor you all took such great care of me while I was there. What a great place for emergencies and surgeries.,4
"I was admitted to Good Sam through the ER, where my jewelry was removed prior to an MRI. As I said, I was very sick and following all the imaging I was transported to the second floor. Starting the next morning from my hospital room, I began calling all over the hospital trying to locate my missing property. and have not found anyone who will help or return a phone call. Not one person who cares what this means to me.
 
 After going upstairs to begin my hospital stay I was placed temporarily in a private room, pending results of a COVID test. Once that came back negative I was moved to the Good Samaritan standard: a double room on a noisy nursing pod. Most facilities have single rooms. Corvallis Good Sam, however, does not. Their patient’s comfort, privacy, ability to rest and heal appears to be of minimum concern to this hospital’s administration.
 
 Which brings me back to the issue of my missing jewelry. This hospital has absolutely no respect for my property. I have spent a total of several hours on the phone, speaking to people who don’t care and leaving voice mail messages which have not been returned.
 
 My advice: proceed with caution when seeking help from this hospital. I was cared for by some very kind nurses (others were dismissive and unpleasant). Same for the doctors: some were great, others not. And the patients bill of rights means absolutely nothing to many of them. My suffering meant nothing to some of them.",1
"I was hired as the Shuttle Bus Driver for Stoneybrook Assisted Living in Corvallis in August 2019 and have spent many hours chatting with the residents while transporting them to doctor's visits at multiple locations throughout the Good Samaritan Regional Medical Center Campus at 3600 NW Samaritan Drive 97330. My experience as a volunteer medical transportation specialist / senior advocate in California for over 15 years has provided me excellent insights into the range of patient care outcomes for seniors. I am super impressed with the staff and facilities at the Good Samaritan Medical Campus in Corvallis. They exhibit a high degree of professionalism and attention to every detail of patient care. My passengers have shared very positive feedback to me and so far I have not fielded a single complaint / unsatisfactory outcome.
 *****FIVE STARS*****",5
I was in the best care. From Outpatient check in to surgery to Med/Surg. All the staff where so kind & professional. God’s Angels. Thankyou over and over again. Every single staff. ♥️,5
I went there because I tore something in my leg and it was the closest hospital. While I was there the nurse I had was nice until she found out how much I weighted and it was a like 180° in her attitude and how she treated me. She didn't even close the door when she started talking about me negatively to the doctor and said that I was too fat for something . I would have put zero stars if the doctor I had hadn't stood up for me when she was talking about me.,3
"I will always come to corvallis ER/Hospital rather then Albany’s. Every single nurse I spoke with was beyond caring and attentive! Especially Dustin one of the RN, goes beyond to make you comfortable. Super satified with our latest visit!",5
"I wish I could review different areas. The resident/family practice clinic is great; everyone I've seen there has been awesome. Same with the Albany clinic. 4-5 stars there. The sleep clinic is meh, 2-3 stars. The ER has generally been okay, but one visit was the worst experience I've ever had in any hospital setting: I had excruciating chest pain - it was so bad I was weeping and throwing up and literally begging for help - and they acted like I was drug-seeking, denying me appropriate pain medication for hours and treating me rudely. I sent them a letter about it and filled out their after-care survey, but never heard a word back from them. Months later I finally got a diagnosis, had surgery, and *again* had trouble getting appropriate pain medication, despite having zero history of any kind of substance abuse. This is not ""do no harm""!",3
I wish there is -5 stars. Management screw their employees over. I feel bad about the employees working there. I pike the service but their management rots.,0
"I would leave negative stars if I could. The staff was friendly but the ER doctor was incompetent. I knew going in that I had sepsis (unfortunately I had a prior experience with septic shock months earlier, and you don't forget 10 days in ICU) he immediately dismissed my concern and said I probably had a bladder infection and prescribed antibiotics. No indication of a bladder issue. He sent me away. I then had to travel home (8 hours). The hospital called me at 7 am the next morning and wanted me to come back right away because I had sepsis again. I told them no. I went to my own ER and was promptly admitted to ICU. The best part of all of this was they sent me a refund of my $600 co-pay back as soon as I was well enough to request it.",0
"I would like to thank the people at Good Sam for being very wonderful, caring and competent people and doing a great job on my emergency surgery.
 There is not a single staff I encountered that does not deserve to be complimented for their outstanding care, they were all quite wonderful.
 Thank you staff at Good Sam, you are all quite amazing.",4
"I would NOT recommend this hospital. FROM THE VERY BEGINNING...the
 very disorganized staff, lackadaisical attitude of treatment and unprofessional with information. Husband had hip replacement surgery, he was sent home with no supplies or instructions on wound care, there has been zero follow up from medical staff with my husband or myself. All conversation prior to being admitted was this a ""day surgery"" after PT you go home. What they didn't say was there is a shot they will give that will numb the entire leg. That shot lasts 2-72 hours. When that wears off then PT can begin. Two days later he came home still having partial numbness and in horrible pain. Oh and there is no waiting room, so hopefully you have a car too sit in while you wait.
 NOT IMPRESSED AT ALL.",0
"I'd seen terrible reviews for this facility before, and although my care was not the most top-notch I'd ever received, the doctors didn't listen to my requests for pertinent tests to my case, and then proceeded to recommend a gallbladder surgery without further investigation, I didn't think it was ALL that bad as far as western medicine as a whole is concerned until today. After being sent to collections, on top of their mediocre (or less) care, I would 100% recommend going to ANY OTHER hospital for your care.",0
"I'm speechless. I've heard rumors about this place in the past, but when I tried to call for an appointment with a specialist for my child, the phone system continually hung up before I could reach a person, and when I finally did get the operator he could not figure out how to get me to the right department. It would almost be comical if it wasn't a situation where I need an appointment urgently. If they can't manage their phones, I don't want the managing my family's medical needs. I'm not at all surprised by all of the one star ratings.",1
If I could give 0 stars that would still be too many. Our college student who is on our family insurance was not provided care and in fact was belittled not only by the receptionist but by the nursing staff as well. He was bleeding due to a cut .Appalling that this was the only after hours option for our son. Our daughter in law who accompanied him bills insurance for a local Dr and was appalled at the lack of knowledge and professionalism. DO NOT COME HERE.,0
"If I could give a zero star review I would. The front desk staff set the tone for everything at the Hospital. I came to visit my father today, we recently found out he has cancer, I won’t go into too much detail but probably stage 3 or 4. I went to the front desk which was unmanned and waited for around three minutes. Then a man comes up who said sorry for the wait what can I do for you and I told him I was here to see my Dad and I’m his daughter. The man said he has hit the limit of visitors and can’t see anyone else because my husband already came that day. Then he gave me the number for the nurses station and said I can take it up with him. The tone this man had with me was horrible like he didn’t care AT ALL why I was there, and didn’t care to help me at all. Zero empathy. Go to a different hospital because as far as the front desk staff that was the WORST experience I’ve ever had",0
"If there was ever a reason to change the name and brand of a business, this is it. My kid was at a basketball camp at Oregon State, Corvallis when she got a concussion. Rules stated she be seen by a doctor within 24 hours. Camp coordinators directed us to Good Samaritan attached to the facility. We went there and they said they didn’t have time to see her today! Huh? They then directed us to a Good Samaritan clinic about 2 miles away. SO, we went there. They said they could see her but that they won’t bill Kaiser (note: Kaiser said they would pay…GS just would not allow that). Why did the first GS not tell us that and instead sent us to another GS? Why would neither see a little girl for a concussion screening? Do none of the employees or administration of Good Samaritan understand the definition of “Good Samaritan?” Perhaps they should look that up in the dictionary and reconsider the name they have chosen for themselves. Or, perhaps they should put a little more thought into their policies for situations like this. Very, very disappointing. What if this were a more dire situation? Totally unacceptable.",0
"If you're having a medical emergency and want to die in a lot of pain, go here. You're going here anyway.",1
"Incredibly awful experience with my wife, she’s been very sick and had an exam scheduled. When checking in the night before the exam to make sure everything was still good we were told she was going to have to reschedule because she was running a fever of 98.9, very rudely I might add (hahahahahahaha). The next available opening was over two months away for this specific test. Living locally in Corvallis, we will do everything to avoid this hospital and advise others in our community to do the same if they can.",0
"Just tried calling the admin of this hospital to ask about changing the hold music from that annoying 3rd grade piano recital music, and was on hold forever. Operator answers lethargically and so I ask if they are short-staffed today or something and she says, No, I'm usually pretty fast..how can I help you? I asked for admin and she starts gatekeeping! I said I will tell them what I want and she argued with me some more, so I said now I understand why your calls are backed up! I asked
 for her supervisor and she transferred me to a dead line. Nope! Not good, not good at all.",1
"Looks like all the bad reviews are for the emergency room, and I will absolutely have to concur. I have never been treated so horribly by any medical facility in my entire life as I was this evening. I have anxiety going to hospitals, as many, many people do. You would think people that work in one could be a little more empathetic to their patients. Firstly, the triage nurse was cold distant and mechanical, ok but she wasn't providing my care. Get to my room and a PA comes in like he is already upset that he even has to be there. Im used to this as most people think anyone comes in to the er and they aren't bleeding out that you are a drug seeker and want to be dopped up. I made it clear from the outset that I did not want narcotics because opioids made me sick. Like very very sick. But this did little to ease him. He is so rude about everything, he performed a paltry exam until I was nearly screaming and was white knuckled from tensing so hard to keep myself still. Then he says to me that there is really nothing he can do and I start crying (panic), because 1) he is treating me like my pain is insignificant or I'm lying and 2) now I know I'm going to continue to be in this pain for the foreseeable future. So my mom who brought me to the ER steps in and starts asking the dr to please take this more seriously as although I'm a chronic pain sufferer, this is not the same kind of pain. He tells my mother I should be used to this kind of pain because I have chronic pain. As my mother persists in insisting he do something like maybe an MRI, he tells her my condition does not merrit an MRI and then asks my mother what she thinks he should do.... um... hello my mother is not the medical ""professional"". At this point I'm begging my mother to please just take me home. And we left. It is very sad that I just Moved to Oregon from Arizona, and my Dog receives better healthcare here than my family does... despicable.",0
"Most insensitive uncaring hospital I've ever been too. Not everyone comes in wanting drugs. Some want to be fixed. Very judgemental. And FYI, nurses, when you come out of a patients room and make jokes to other nurses about them, makes us patients watching you wonder if you do it to them too. Just saying.. Unprofessional. . grow up.. I got to say, after reading all the reviews of crappy service, and absolutely no changes obviously made. Does any of the higher ups read the reviews???? Or just don't care as long as they get their big paychecks????? WOW!!! Can you say ""HEARTLESS""",0
"My family and I were transported to GSRMC after our head on collision. They were amazing. My family included myself, my husband and our 4 young children ages 7, 4, 2 and 1. The staff took care of my kids like they were their own. My husband said nothing but good things about the ER staff that treated him. The staff that treated me were great too. They made sure both my husbands parents and my parents were with our children at all times. We also had a waiting room full of people and they were given their own waiting room. After my husband and I were admitted, they did everything in their power to get us a room together and our nurses even pushed our beds together. They were very empathetic with us and reminded us how the injuries would take time to heal but so would the mental aspects of our accident. People were there to answer any questions we had or our family members had. I can't say enough good things about our experience. This isn't my first experience with GSRMC either. All of our time spent there was met with friendly and knowledgeable staff.",4
"My husband broke his left humerus 2 years ago and was transported to this hospital because it was closer to his location. The orthopedics @ this hospital performed a surgery by placing a rod in his arm, and sent him home saying that “it would heal up just fine and he doesn’t need any more appointments unless there is a pain”. Dr. Snow, who is no longer there told my husband that his bone is going to heal up without any problems and he doesn’t need to come back unless he experiences pain. Well 5 months into the surgery the rod broke from the inside causing pain in the arm. We went back to the Orthopedics clinic for the check up to find out what was going on. At that time they took xrays and told my husband that his rod has broken and therefore he will need another surgery. So @ that time we told them what Dr Snow has told us how his bone was heeling fine and no further surgeries were required. Well the doctors @ the orthopedics were kept saying how they dont agree with Dr snow and how another surgery was necessary in order to fix the arm. At that time my husband and i were so confused and didn’t know what to do, because i am a stay home mom and he is the only one working. So we decided to get an opinions from different doctors who are in a different hospital other then samaritan. We were in a search of a good doctor, who wont provide us with misunderstandings. We found a orthopedic surgeon at Kaiser Permanente who is currently working with us. When my husband went there to see him @ Kaiser he explained to my husband everything that went wrong with his first surgery @ Samaritan. He also explained to us that there were many things that doctors @ samaritan should have done in order to heel the bone at first place. So, now unfortunately 2 years later my husband is going to have another surgery to fix his arm due to malpractice of the orthopedics surgeons @ smaratian. I feel like i should just sue the Smaritan hospital and there orthopedic surgeons for their malpractice and giving wrong information to their patients. We are the onces who will pay the price for their mistakes and the loss to my husband, who will not be able to work for @ least 3 months. I highly recommend avoiding this hospital and as well as there other locations. I am writing this review so another person doesn’t have to suffer like my husband is right now.",0
MY HUSBAND HAD SURGERY TODAY AT G.S. WE WERE TREATED WITH RESPECT AND HAD ABSOLUTELY THE BEST EXPERIENCE. EVERY STAFF MEMBER WAS HELPFUL AND PROFESSIONAL. THANK YOU FOR MAKING OUR SHORT STAY PLEASANT.,4
My mom had a procedure done here. She was helicoptered from Medford Oregon.,2
"My mom is a guest here, dementia stuff. Excellent staff, all. Very caring, clean facilities, and her team was awesome in their care of her. While visiting yesterday, we were treated to a complete double rainbow and a single. I am quite happy with this facility!",5
My mother expirenced harassment and unprofessional behavior from a male nurse at this hospital. I will be making sure that man is fired and if not I will make sure to make his name and actions public. Degenerate people prey on the sick.,0
"My Mother has had to be admitted into Good Samaritan Regional Medical Ctr. several times over the past 6 months for various illnesses and each time the staff including Doctors and Nurses have done and outstanding job of treating her ! I am very impressed by the staff at this facility and I would not hesitate to let them treat me if needed, as a matter of fact I have been treated there in the past with the same outstanding care !",5
"My mother-in-law was recently admitted with a broken hip, and I tried calling several times, but most of the time nobody bothers answering the phone, and whenever someone does answer on a rare occasion, the call gets dropped during the transfer. People who work in a hospital need to be more empathetic and understand the concern we have for family members who’ve been admitted there. They need to start giving a damn about their job and other people, rather than just thinking about themselves. I guarantee that if was one of their loved ones, they would care. If they’re incapable of this, it’s time for them to seek out some other profession.",1
My sister came into the emergency room because she was in labor and they got her into a room immediately. They have been so nice and informative and have been taking good care of my sister and her newborn. So thankful that we made it here! She is happy she had her child here.,5
"My son was taken in for a dog that attacked his face. I know social media plays a big part in todays society. Just wanted to say how great and amazing all the nurses, doctor and staff were. Beyond friendly and super caring and calming. It was a scary event seeing my 2 year old in a hospital bed but they really made the situation alot better for my little man. They even gave him a stuffed animal for him to take home. Thank you so much everyone who helped with my son. I have nothing but great reviews on how everything went .",5
My wife and daughter spent 4 hours in emergency. Before leaving and coming home to go to McMinnville emergency doctor. I will keep you updated on whether on not she is admitted. What a joke this hospital is.,1
"No accountability of their staff or doctors. Very difficult to reach administration staff. Absolute joke trying to deal with thier patient exceptions staff. Even when you can or do provide documentation backing up your complaint or issues they state sorry you feel that way. Facts are irrelevant when it comes to this company. Unfortunately they seem to hold a medical monopoly in both Linn and Benton counties. Even worse the state contracts with IHN , Inter community health network, as the only CCO for both counties. IHN is I. Fact a Samaritan based health insurance insurance company, handling medical/dental/mental. They are horrible to say the least. You'd be better going outside the area to get more professional care",0
No one answers the phone!,2
Not only were the desk people seriously rude but they were refusing to update me on anything i asked. I even asked the doctor and he was confused as to why they had kept the info from me when it was my client that was admitted,1
"NOT SAFE FOR NON-COVID. Went in to the ER for potential reaction after an iron infusion. No temp check at the entrance but they wanted me to sanitize my hands, which was strange. I was triaged and taken to a room. When I arrived at the room I asked the
 Nurse if they kept their Covid and non-Covid patients separated...she shrugged her shoulders and said “not really”, to which I said “I need to leave because I’m a high risk for severe Covid”. I asked her if I would be charged and she said “we’ll probably, you were triaged. Talk to the front desk”. I left and stopped at the front desk and asked, to which the man said “you have to talk to the nurse”. I informed him that she directed me to him. He gave me a phone number to call. I asked him how this ER expected to keep non-Covid patients safe if they don’t separate them...to which he shrugged his shoulders and told me to direct questions to the nurse. I left so fast and went to Salem.This ER is not safe in these times. If you have an option, choose anywhere else!",1
Only Hospital on the planet I think where the bathrooms and dining area and most waiting rooms are NOT wheelchair accessible. Kind of crazy for a Hospital.,1
